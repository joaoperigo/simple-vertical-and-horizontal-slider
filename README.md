# Very Simple Vertical and Horizontal Slider
Simple vertical and horizontal slider for study basics features for this kind of tool - HTML, CSS, JQUERY and scrollto, by Ariel Flesler

## Concept
The elements are wrapped one inside other. The height of the slides and the total of slides height were stored ins some vars. But with jquery plugin named scrollto, this only uses anchor link know. 

The structure of elements is wrappers with another wrapper with elements inside.The wrappers have position fixed, and the child elements, the slides, have position relative. So when you navigate with anchor link and scrollto jquery plugin, works like a slider.

It's very simple, each image you have to copy past, name a new id. And copy past each dot to, and name the anchor link equal to this current id of the slide.

## History
I did this when I was a little bit newbie at Javascript. This slide have 7 years, When I did this I had more free time, and at this time I did not like to use ready plugins or libraries, so I made this Slider. So be advised that this code could use "each", or some better new selector in javascript.

The client changed mind about vertical slider, and the horizontal one remained.

## Zoom (only in horizontal)
I had to apply a zoom because of portrait images, as the slide, in this case should be the same size of landscape window.

## Details
Sliders are difficult things to work with, at least in web developing, because it may create extra content who surpass the semantic context of an information in the document.  The structure of this slider is simple, and I think there is no overcontented, because there is not a lot of lines and files here.

# Very Simple Vertical Slider
Simple vertical slider for study basics features for this kind of tool - HTML, CSS, JQUERY and scrollto, by Ariel Flesler

The elements are wrapped one inside other. The height of the slides and the total of slides height were stored ins some vars. But with jquery plugin named scrollto, this only uses anchor link know. 

The structure of elements is wrappers with another wrapper with elements inside.The wrappers have position fixed, and the child elements, the slides, have position relative. So when you navigate with anchor link and scrollto jquery plugin, works like a slider.

I did this when I was a little bit newbie in Javascript. This slide have 7 years, When I did this I had more free time, and at this time I did not like to use ready plugins or libraries, so I made this Slider. So be advised that this code could use "each", or some better new selector in javascript.

Sliders are difficult things to work with, at least in web developing, because it may create extra content who surpass the semantic context of an information in the document.  The structure of this slider is simple, and I think there is no overcontented, because there is not a lot of lines and files here.
